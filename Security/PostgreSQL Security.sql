/* 
   Objects need owners. 
   Whenever a user creates an object, they become the owner by default. 
   Users can also create an object on behalf of another user. 
   The owner has full control over the object. 
   Only the owner of an object can drop the object.

/*
DB object privileges allow a user to take specific actions. These privileges are:
   - CREATE:   The user can create a new database. This should be reserved for DBAs.
   - CONNECT:  The user can connect to the database. 
               This privilege is typically used for the general user 
               because all users need to connect to the database to use PostgreSQL.
   - TEMP:     The user can create temporary tables while using the database.
